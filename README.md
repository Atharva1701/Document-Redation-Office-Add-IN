# Document Redaction Add-in for Microsoft Word

A Microsoft Word task-pane add-in that automatically redacts sensitive information from documents, inserts a **CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT** header, and optionally enables Track Changes — all in one click.

---

## Features

- **Sensitive data redaction** across all document paragraphs:
  - Email addresses → `[EMAIL REDACTED]`
  - Phone numbers (US formats) → `[PHONE REDACTED]`
  - Social Security Numbers → `[SSN REDACTED]`
  - Credit card numbers (Luhn-validated, 13–19 digits) → `[CREDIT CARD REDACTED]`
- **Confidential header** — inserts `CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT` at the top of the document (idempotent; skipped if already present)
- **Track Changes** — enables revision tracking via the Word JavaScript API when the host supports it (WordApi 1.5 + WordApiDesktop 1.4)
- **Redaction summary** — displays a per-category count of all redactions made and reports the tracking/header status

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **npm** ≥ 9
- **Microsoft Word** — desktop (Windows/Mac) or Word on the Web
- A local HTTPS certificate pair (`localhost.pem` + `localhost-key.pem`) in the project root

### Generating a local certificate

If you do not already have a trusted local certificate, use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert):

```bash
# Install mkcert (macOS example)
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install

# Generate certs in the project root
cd office-challenge
mkcert localhost
```

This produces `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem`, which are referenced by `vite.config.ts`.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd office-challenge

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server (HTTPS, port 3000)
npm run dev
```

Then sideload the add-in into Word using `manifest.xml` (see [Sideloading](#sideloading) below).

### Available scripts

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite dev server on `https://localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check without emitting files |

---

## Sideloading

If automatic sideloading does not trigger, follow Microsoft's manual sideload guide:

- **Word on the Web** — [Sideload Office Add-ins in Office on the web](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing#sideload-an-office-add-in-in-office-on-the-web)
- **Word Desktop (Windows)** — [Sideload Office Add-ins on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing#sideload-an-office-add-in-on-windows)
- **Word Desktop (Mac)** — [Sideload Office Add-ins on Mac](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing#sideload-an-office-add-in-on-mac)

---

## Usage

1. Open any `.docx` file in Microsoft Word.
2. Open the **Document Redaction** task pane from the add-in.
3. Click **Redact document**.
4. A summary card appears showing how many items of each type were redacted.

The add-in is idempotent — running it multiple times on an already-redacted document will not produce duplicate headers or double-redact tokens.

---

## How It Works

### Redaction pipeline (`src/redactor/redactor.ts`)

1. **Track Changes** — attempts to enable `document.trackRevisions` if WordApi 1.5 and WordApiDesktop 1.4 requirement sets are both available on the current host.
2. **Confidential header** — reads the document body text and inserts a `CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT` paragraph at the start only if it is not already present.
3. **Pattern matching** — iterates every paragraph, runs four regex passes (email → phone → SSN → card candidate), and replaces matches in-place via `paragraph.insertText(…, Word.InsertLocation.replace)`.
4. **Credit card validation** — card-shaped digit sequences are passed through a Luhn checksum (`src/redactor/luhn.ts`) before being redacted, minimising false positives.

### Regex patterns (`src/redactor/patterns.ts`)

| Type | Pattern highlights |
|---|---|
| Email | RFC-5321 local part + domain, case-insensitive |
| Phone | US 10-digit numbers with optional country code, various separators |
| SSN | Strict `\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}` format |
| Credit card | 13–19 digit sequences (spaces/dashes allowed), Luhn-validated |

---

## Word API Requirements

| Feature | Requirement set |
|---|---|
| Task pane, document read/write | WordApi 1.1 |
| `trackRevisions` | WordApi 1.5 + WordApiDesktop 1.4 |

Track Changes is gracefully degraded — if the host does not support the required sets, redaction and header insertion proceed normally and a note is shown in the summary.

## Testing

A sample document (`Document-To-Be-Redacted.docx`) is included in the repository root and contains representative instances of all four sensitive data types. Use it to verify end-to-end behaviour before deploying against other documents.

> **Note:** The redaction logic is document-agnostic. Ensure your patterns cover the formats present in any document you intend to process.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is written to `dist/`. Update the `manifest.xml` `<SourceLocation>` to point to your production host before distributing.
